# Roadmap for PySpeak Development

## User Identification

### Unique Identifier (UID)
- **UID:** A unique identifier for each user.
- **Nickname:** Display name for other users, which can be changed freely.
- **Identities:** Ability to create and manage multiple identities (each with a unique UID) that can have the same nickname as others.

## User Permissions

### Standard User
- Basic rights to connect to the server, chat, and switch rooms.

### Channel Administrator
- Rights to manage specific rooms, create/delete rooms, kick/ban users from rooms. Can be assigned by administrators.

### Server Administrator
- Full rights over the entire server, including managing users and channel administrators. Can be created by Super Administrator.

### Super Administrator
- Full rights over the entire server, including managing users and administrators. The owner of the server, must provide the server-specific privilege key.

## User Profiles

### Profile Information
- 

### Settings
- Customizable settings for audio, notifications, and other preferences.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Token-based Authentication
- Secure handling of user sessions using token-based authentication.

### Role-based Authorization
- Simple assignment and control of user permissions using role-based authorization.

## Communication Protocol

### WebSockets
- For real-time communication between clients and the server.

### Protocol Design
- Define a clear and well-structured protocol for message transfer between clients and the server.

### Encryption
- Use strong encryption to protect user data during transmission.

### Quality of Service (QoS)
- Implement mechanisms to ensure high-quality audio transmission, such as jitter buffering and packet loss concealment.

## Connection Management

### Rate Limiting
- Prevent abuse and ensure server performance using rate limiting.

### Logging and Monitoring
- Track user activity and server status using logging and monitoring.

# Ideas
- ## Centralized User Database
- Instead of having separate databases for each client and server, use a centralized database for user management that can be accessed by all servers and clients.
